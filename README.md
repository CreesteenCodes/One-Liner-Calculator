# ðŸ§® One-Liner-Calculator
A simple yet elegant **One-Liner Calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed with a sleek **Glassmorphism** effect.  
This project demonstrates how minimalism and modern UI trends can combine to create a clean, functional calculator interface.

# ðŸ§© How It Works
1. The calculator accepts input as a **single-line arithmetic expression** (e.g., `12 + 3 * 2`).  
2. When the `=` button is pressed (or Enter key is hit), JavaScript evaluates the expression.  
3. The result is displayed instantly in the output field.  
4. You can clear the input using the `C` button or backspace to correct entries.
