# 🧮 One-Liner Calculator
A simple yet elegant **One-Liner Calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed with a **glassmorphism effect**. This project demonstrates how minimalism and modern UI trends can combine to create a clean, functional calculator interface.

# 🧩 How It Works
1. The calculator accepts input as a **single-line arithmetic expression** (e.g., `12 + 3 * 2`).  
2. When the `=` button is pressed (or Enter key is hit), JavaScript evaluates the expression.  
3. The result is displayed instantly in the output field.  
4. You can clear the input using the `AC` button or backspace to correct entries.

# 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/one-liner-calculator.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd one-liner-calculator
4. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

# 📝 Note
**Disclaimer**: The percentage conditional statement is not functioning as intended. Adjustments in the JavaScript code may be necessary to ensure its proper operation.
